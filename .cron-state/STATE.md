# Sunsprout autonomous cron — STATE

> You are Cake. Read me FIRST every tick.

## STATUS

**STATUS:** Tick #5 complete. 25 autoship features now on `feature/autoship`. This batch shipped Winter pass + Hot Cocoa, pickaxe upgrades, quest log panel, heart-4 NPC hangouts, and the rooftop cat companion. 763/763 tests green (+66 this tick); build 154.80 kB / 47.68 kB gz.

Active branch: `feature/autoship`
Default branch: `main` (NEVER push to it from cron)
Cron identity: `Cake (cron) <51058514+Sanjays2402@users.noreply.github.com>`

## OPERATING RULES (do not violate)

1. Work on `feature/autoship` only. No merges to main. No PRs (`gh pr create` BANNED). No tags. No `gh release`.
2. No emoji in any git artifact (commit messages, branch names, file contents touched by cron). Telegram delivery may use emoji.
3. One feature slice = one commit. ~5 commits per tick.
4. Gate ONCE per batch at the end (`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `npm test`). Push only if green.
5. Quality is the floor. If only 3 features are genuinely solid, ship 3 and say so. Never pad.

## ROADMAP (cozy-life essentials + depth)

## OPEN BLOCKERS

(none — but key bindings are very tight. Recent additions: `,` `.` `[` `]` `X` `R` `;` `V` `Q` `\\` `/` `'` `-`. Open letter keys: numerics, `{` `}` `` ` ``, F-keys, `=`, `~`. Future panels should seriously consider sharing a single panel-toggle key cycling through panels.)
